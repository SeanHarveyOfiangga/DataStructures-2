# Write a python program that do the following:

# - display the initial content of the array
# - display a menu of options
# - allow user to select item in the menu (check if valid)
# - perform the selected option (you may prompt additional info to user when need)
# - display the resulting values of the array


# Note: 
# - The program has an array variable containing 10 random numbers
# - You may add other options and features
# - Your program should be uploaded to github before 1:30pm
# - Record a demo presenting your program
# - Send the demo directly to my messenger

# Example Output:

# Array: [1, 4, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6 ,2 ,56, 200]
# Menu:
#  1 -> Add an element
#  2 -> Insert an element
#  3 -> Modify an element
#  4 -> Delete an element
#  5 -> Arrange in ascending order
#  6 -> Arrange in descending order
# What do you want to do? (1-6): 4
# Enter the index you want to delete: 3
# The element has been deleted
# This is the new array: Array: [1, 4, 3, 4, 5, 6 ,2 ,56, 200]

#Introduction and user input

def Intro():
    print("Welcome to my array program!")
Intro()
#User input

def User():
    list1 = []
    for i in range(10):
        content = int(input("\nPlease enter 10 random numbers: "))
        list1.append(content)
        print(list1)
    print(f"\nYou picked {list1}")
    return list1
User()
